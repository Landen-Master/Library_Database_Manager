All data files needed to recreate the database are here in the "data" folder. There are 3 sets of data, with Set 2
referencing keys in set 1, and Set 2 referencing keys in set 2. Files can be executed in any order, as long as all
files from Set 1 are executed before Set 2, and all files in Set 2 are executed before Set 3. The files in each set
can be seen below.

Set 1:	Data_Patron
	Data_Library_Branch
	Data_Artist
	Data_Director
	Data_Actor
	Data_Author
	Data_Album
	Data_Movie
	Data_Audiobook
	Data_Track

Set 2:	Data_Employee
	Data_Order
	Data_Artist_Song
	Data_Artist_Album
	Data_Author_Book
	Data_Directed
	Data_Cast
	Data_Track_On_Album
	Data_Chapter
	Data_Item_Storage
	Data_Check_Out

Set 3:	Data_Employee_Work

Alternatively, the file "populate.txt" contains all information set across all files, and can be loaded and executed
instead of loading each file individually.
